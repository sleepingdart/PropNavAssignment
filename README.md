This project contains files for the proportional navigation simulation interview challenge. The code consists of 3 files:
runPropNav.py - this is the main file to run the sim and generate outputs. Set the value of any input parameters here.
RK4.py - performs numerical integration given the state function and a time vector. Also calculates the requested miss distance and intercept angle quantities.
eom_propnav.py - defines equations governing the dynamics of this simulation. 

To run the simulation: Modify any desired input variables in runPropNav.py, then run the runPropNav.py
